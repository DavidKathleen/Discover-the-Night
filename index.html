    <h2>To: My Ikay,</h2>
    <p>
      I know you’ve been carrying so much on your shoulders.  
      Maybe more than you ever admit.  
      You carry your family, and yourself in ways most people never see, holding responsibilities
      that aren’talways fair, but you still rise every day and give more. You stay 
      soft even when life is hard, and you keep loving even when your own heart is tired.
      You’ve become the gentle one, the strong one, the one your family leans on but not
      because they asked for it, but because your heart is built differently. Your strength
      doesn;t demand to be seen, instead it reveals itself quietly in the way you 
      move through the world, in the sacrifices you dont talk about, and in the patience you
      keep even when the worlds feels heavy. You don't shine becuase everything is easy, you
      shine because you keep going even when it isn;'t. You are that kind of constellation in my life, love.
      someone whose deserves to be remembered, whose softness survives the storms, 
      and whose light stays, even on days you feel dim.</p>

      <p>
      This little letter is here to remind you that you don’t have to be strong alone.  
      Even the brightest constellations rest in the dark sky.  
      so please, let yourself rest too.  
      You are doing more than enough, and I’m proud of you every single day.
    </p>
    <h4>From: Your baby, Kath</h4>
